                    <p>Hi, welcome to my website! My name is Tyler Kim.</p>
                    <p>I am currently in my 4th year at Cal Poly, studying Industrial Engineering. I am interested in personal and organizational leadership, product management, and software development!</p>
                    <p>In my free time, you will find me surfing, reading, or spending time in nature- where I often go for solace and inspiration.
                    </p>
